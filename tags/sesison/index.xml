      <description>Earlier I wrote an article on how to re-use a session in Selenium using Java. @Jim Hazen asked if the I could provide the implementation of same in C#. So here it is
The first time I worked out this approach was in C# only, but that was back in 2014. That time I copied code from the Selenium source code and modified it. This makes upgrading Selenium version difficult.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I wrote an article on how to re-use a session in Selenium using Python. @Aditya Baraskar asked if the same was possible in Java.
Once you know the concepts, languages usually is no barrier. So I tried using the same approach that we did in Python and see how it works out in Java
Attempt 1 ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); HttpCommandExecutor executor = (HttpCommandExecutor) driver.getCommandExecutor(); URL url = executor.</description>

      <description>Comparison between Selenium and UFT Behavior For those of us who come from a QTP/UFT background, being able to test the same browser after a disconnect is usually a piece of cake
1. systemutil.run &amp;quot;iexplore.exe&amp;quot; 2. x = 2/0 3. Browser(&amp;quot;index:=0&amp;quot;).navigate (&amp;quot;http://www.google.com&amp;quot;)  If we run the above script in QTP/UFT, the script will error out on Line #2 and we can re-run the script from Line #3 and it would still work and navigate inside the browser we had opened earlier.</description>
